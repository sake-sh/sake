# sake.sh

CI + CDN for Homebrew Taps.

## How to use (for developers)

### 1. Install sake.sh GitHub Apps

For sake.sh to watch the release events, [install GitHub Apps](https://github.com/apps/sake-sh) on your personal account or organizations.

### 2. Create a new release

As soon as you create a new release, sake.sh will start handling the event, detecting programming language, version, description, and release assets, produces a tailor-made formula for your app which will be available at `https://sake.sh/<user|org>`.

### 3. Your tap is ready to serve

You don't have to maintain a separate `homebrew-<name>` repository anymore. Every time you publish a release, sake.sh will automatically create a Homebrew formula and keep it updated. Users will get a new version of your app through Homebrew Tap served by sake.sh.

## How to use (for users)

```bash
brew tap sake.sh/<user|org> https://sake.sh/<user|org>
brew tap sake.sh/uetchy https://sake.sh/uetchy

brew install gst
```

## Supported Types

### Go

### Generic

Anything that sake.sh failed to detect the language would fall into `generic` type (i.e., just-provide-binary type).

sake.sh will look out for arch-specific binaries in the release assets. If there is a binary for macOS, then sake.sh generates a formula for that binary.

## Roadmap (Wishlist)

- âœ… Basic functions
- Support more languages
